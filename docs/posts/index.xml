I decided to continue working on this project and add what I think is the next logical piece of functionality, ASR or automatic speech recognition. This means I should be able to provide either audio data from a microphone or from an audio file and have the speech transcribed.</description></item><item><title>ðŸ¦¬ Wyoming In Go</title><link>https://john-pettigrew.github.io/posts/wyoming/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2024 13:20:23 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://john-pettigrew.github.io/posts/wyoming/</guid><description>The Setup I was working on a side project the other day and I needed to generate some spoken audio from generated text. This is called &amp;ldquo;Text to Speech&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;TTS&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s also &amp;ldquo;Speech to Text&amp;rdquo; or STT, and a few other acronyms to memorize for fun.
I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of Home Assistant and last year they had several updates for their &amp;ldquo;Year of the Voice&amp;rdquo;. These updates gave the project functionality like those home smart speakers that were super popular for a while.</description></item></channel></rss>
