This is called &amp;ldquo;Text to Speech&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;TTS&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s also &amp;ldquo;Speech to Text&amp;rdquo; or STT, and a few other acronyms to memorize for fun.
I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of Home Assistant and last year they had several updates for their &amp;ldquo;Year of the Voice&amp;rdquo;. These updates gave the project functionality like those home smart speakers that were super popular for a while.</description></item></channel></rss>
